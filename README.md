By using simple moving average 

SMA is one the best technical analysis indicator , it will be helful for people wether to invest or not  

SMA Crossover Strategy
A simple moving average is the simplest form of a moving average. A moving average is a mean value calculated over a specific number of recent data points. This value is periodically re-calculated, kicking out the oldest value in favour of the most recent period.

We calculate values using the simple moving average formula:

Formula : SMA = (Sum of price values for n periods) / n

The greater the value for n, the smoother our moving average line will be, but the slower it will react to changes in the price. Smaller values for n will produce a faster-moving SMA line. It will react quicker to changes in the price, but it will be less smooth.

It can be useful to compare a faster (i.e. a shorter period) SMA with a slower (i.e. a longer period) one. Using shorter and longer period, we visualize it as signal on the plot which help us whether we should sell or buy the share. So, basically it helps in trading in the stock market.

Trading Strategy: SMA Crossover

The simple moving average crossover strategy is a fairly basic trend-following system. It looks at two different price series, and provides a trading signal when one crosses over the other. In the plot, we can see that the price crossing was above a 50-period moving average. As an alternative, we can also use another moving average instead of the price.

The key is that the direction of the signal is given by the direction of the cross of the faster-moving price series, over the slower one. So, for example, we might use a 50-period moving average as the fast series, and a 200-period moving average as the slower one. If the 50-period moving average crossed above the 200-period moving average, it would be a buy signal. If the 50-period moving average crossed below the slower moving average, it would be a sell signal
